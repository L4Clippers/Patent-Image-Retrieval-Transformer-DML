[![PWC](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://paperswithcode.com/badge/patent-image-retrieval-using-transformer/image-retrieval-on-deeppatent)](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-retrieval-on-deeppatent?p=patent-image-retrieval-using-transformer)

## Summary
The repository contains a Patent Image Retrieval, Transformer backbone, deep metric learning, and preprocessing in Python/PyTorch.

The repository is based on the paper: Kotaro Higuchi, Keiji Yanai, **Patent Image Retrieval Using Transformer-based Deep Metric Learning**, World Patent Information(WPI) 2023. [[Abstract(WPI)]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0172219023000479) 

## Update(Dec 17, 2023)
- Our pre-trained models are available at this following [[link]](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/n3tjkvsxfmi7cvacei6wj/h?rlkey=xf5686zlzmlkkhr8k3eajxo8k&dl=0).

## Update(Jul 21, 2023)
- This project was accepted to World Patent Information. We achieved the State-Of-The-Art(SOTA) score of mAP in patent image retrieval.

- Pre-training & Fine-tuning codes
- DeepPatent link [[Project]](https://github.com/GoFigure-LANL/DeepPatent-dataset)

## Update(Feb 1, 2023)
- Initial project "Patent Image Retrieval using Cross-entropy-based Metric Learning" was released. The paper was accepted to International Workshop on Frontiers of Computer Vision(IW-FCV). We achieved to search patent image without traditional IPC or CPC.

## Requirements
- PyTorch > 1.6.0
- torchvision > 0.7.0
- Pytorch Metric Learning
- CUDA
- CuDNN
- FAISS
- OpenCV
- Graphic board (worked at NVIDIA A6000*8)

## Instllation
### Requisites
- PyTorch Metric Learning
  -  ``conda install -c conda-forge pytorch-metric-learning``
- FAISS
  -  ``conda install -c conda-forge faiss-gpu``
### Run
- Jupyter Notebook
  - Run this Notebook file on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## Note
- This repository contains the legendary version of the ArcFace implementation with the Python interface. [Code](https://github.com/ronghuaiyang/arcface-pytorch/blob/master/models/metrics.py)
- We tested this notebook with Python3, on Ubuntu.
- Patlist is from DeepPatent dataset. It teaches the path to the substantial dataset.

## Dataset
- If you would like to fine-tune on an conventional dataset, you must prepare the DeepPatent dataset. [[Project]](https://github.com/GoFigure-LANL/DeepPatent-dataset)
- Same test/val/train split as the DeepPatent dataset

## Models
- Our pre-trained models are available at this following [[link]](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/n3tjkvsxfmi7cvacei6wj/h?rlkey=xf5686zlzmlkkhr8k3eajxo8k&dl=0).
